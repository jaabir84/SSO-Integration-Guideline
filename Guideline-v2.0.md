## SECTION 1: SYSTEM OVERVIEW

### System Overview

#### SSO Integration

SSO Integration uses Keycloak, an open-source Identity and Access Management (IAM) for modern apps like single-page applications, mobile apps, and REST APIs. The services provided to facilitate the integration of SSO include:

-   **Authentication**: Centralized login service to verify user identities
-   **Authorization**: Role-based and implements detailed access control for applications
-   **Token Management**: Issuance and validation of tokens using OpenID Connect protocol.
-   **User Federation**: Integration with external user directories like LDAP, Active Directory and more.

#### System Architecture

<a id="_bookmark8"></a>
<div align="center">

![System Architecture Diagram](images/media/image3.jpeg)

**Figure 1: System Architecture**

</div>

#### System Architecture Flow

1.  The user will go to the Login Page in the 3rd party application. The 3rd party application will be redirected to the Keycloak.
2.  Keycloak then will be redirected to MyDOW Connector (OIDC).
3.  MyDOW Connector will generate a unique QR Code and will display it to the user.
4.  The user clicks the QR Code (mobile) or scans the QR Code (browser) and authenticates using the MyDigital ID application.
5.  MyDigital ID application connects to MyDOW Connector and performs 3-way handshaking.
6.  On the 3rd handshake, MyDOW Connector will receive the user certificate and check the certificate with OCSP.
7.  MyDOW connector will return the auth token to Keycloak and Keycloak will return the token to the 3rd party application.

#### MyDigital ID SSO Platform

MyDigital ID SSO platform consists of the Identity and Access Management (IAM) platform on the frontend that supports OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect. Keycloak provides the functionality to manage authentication client secret, authentication flow behavior and other operational elements that is required by OAuth 2.0 and OIDC to function.

MyDOW OIDC Connector plugin is a purpose-built plugin that was developed to interface OIDC with the mechanism that performs 3-way handshaking of MyDigital ID (refer to MyDigital ID Integration Guideline Document). In essence, MyDOW OIDC connector is presented as an Identity Provider to Keycloak.

#### Keycloak SSO Protocol

Keycloak uses industry-standard protocols like OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect secure authentication and authorization. Using industry-standard protocols is crucial not only for ensuring robust security but also for simplifying integration with both existing and new applications.

#### OAuth 2.0

With OAuth 2.0, sharing user data to third-party applications is easy, does not require sharing user credentials, and allows control over what data is shared. Four (4) roles defined in OAuth 2.0:

-   **Resource owner**: The end user that owns resources that an application wants to access.
-   **Resource server**: The service hosting the protected resources.
-   **Client**: The application that would like to access the resource.
-   **Authorization server**: The server issuing access to the client, which is the role of Keycloak.

In an OAuth 2.0 protocol flow, the client requests access to a resource on behalf of a resource owner from the authorization server. The authorization server issues limited access to the resource at the resource server by including access token in the request.

<a id="figure-2-simplified-oauth-2.0-authorization-code-grant-type"></a>
<div align="center">

![Simplified OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code Grant Type](images/media/image4.jpeg)

**Figure 2: Simplified OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code Grant Type**

</div>

The steps in the diagram are as follows:

1.  The application sends an authentication request to the user's browser to be redirected to Keycloak for authorization.
2.  The browser redirects the user to Keycloak's authorization page.
3.  If the user is not authenticated with Keycloak, Keycloak authenticates the user
4.  The application gets an authorization code from Keycloak.
5.  The application then exchanges the code for an access token from Keycloak.
6.  The application uses the access token to access the protected resource.

Access tokens are passed around from the application to services, usually having a short lifetime. To get new access tokens without repeating the whole process, a refresh token is used.

#### OpenID Connect

Since OAuth 2.0 is for authorization, but not authentication, OpenID Connect adds an authentication layer on top of OAuth 2.0. OpenID Connect has enabled a whole ecosystem of websites to no longer need to deal with user management and authenticating users. OpenID Connect is useful to have a centralized solution for authentication supporting single sign-on and increases security as applications do not have access to the user credentials directly. Furthermore, it enables the use of stronger authentication, such as OTP or WebAuthn, without the need to support it directly within applications.

OpenID Connect (OIDC) involves three (3) main roles in its protocol:

1.  **End user**: It is the same as the resource owner in OAuth 2.0. This is simply the human being who is logging in or being authenticated.
2.  **Relying Party (RP):** The application or website that needs to verify or authenticate the end user.
3.  **OpenID Provider (OP):** The identity provider that is authenticating the user, which is the role of Keycloak.

In OpenID Connect, the RP asks the OP for the user's identity and can also obtain a token since it builds on OAuth 2.0. OpenID Connect uses OAuth 2.0's Authorization Code grant but adds `scope=openid` to make it an **authentication request** instead of just an **authorization request**. There are two (2) flows in OpenID Connect:

1.  **Authorization code flow**: This follows the OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code flow, returning an authorization code that can be exchanged for an ID token, access token, and refresh token.
2.  **Hybrid flow**: The ID token and authorization code are returned together in the initial request.

<div align="center">

![Simplified OpenID Connect Authorization Code Flow](images/media/image5.jpeg)

**Figure 3: Simplified OpenID Connect Authorization Code Flow**

</div>

The steps in the diagram are as follows:

1.  The app prepares a request to authenticate and asks the user's browser to be redirected to Keycloak.
2.  The browser redirects the user to Keycloak's login page (authorization endpoint).
3.  If the user is not logged in yet, Keycloak will ask them to log in.
4.  The app gets an authorization code from Keycloak as a response.
5.  The app then exchanges this authorization code with Keycloak for an ID token and an access token.
6.  The app uses the ID token to identify the user and start a logged-in session.

#### MyDigital ID SSO Protocol Sequence

<a id="_bookmark17"></a>
<div align="center">

![MyDigital ID SSO Protocol Sequence Diagram](images/media/image6.jpeg)

**Figure 4: MyDigital ID SSO Protocol Sequence Diagram**

</div>

##### MyDigital ID SSO Protocol Sequence Components

**Components:**

1.  **User**: The end-user requesting access to resources.
2.  **3rd-Party Application (App)**: The client application consists of a mobile application or web application that the user interacts with.
3.  **MyDigitalID App**: An app responsible for verifying users and generating tokens.
4.  **Keycloak/MyDOW Cluster (OIDC Provider)**: The OpenID Connect (OIDC) provider for handling authentication.
5.  **WebSocket Cluster (WSS)**: Manages WebSocket connections for real-time communication.
6.  **Signet Cluster**: Handles secure token verification and status updates.

##### Flow Explanation:

1.  **User Request**
    -   The user makes a request to the application for a resource, but there is no prior authentication.

2.  **Redirect to Keycloak**
    -   The application redirects the user to Keycloak for authentication.
    -   Keycloak detects the Mydigital ID Identity Provider as the IDP stated in the authentication flow of the client.
    -   Keycloak redirects requests to MyDigital MyDOW IDP which then produces the unique nonce and generates the MyDigital ID QR code to be scanned and application url link to Signet server if the QR is clicked.

3.  **Action and Token Generation**
    -   The user performs an action by scanning using MyDigital ID app (Desktop web app) or click on the QR code (Mobile app or Mobile PWA)
    -   MyDigitalID commence the MyDigital ID authentication protocol (3- way handshaking)

4.  **WebSocket Initiation**
    -   While the MyDigital ID app is bound to the websocket server, the 3rd party application is also connected with the Websocket Connections. The connections from the 3rd party application will join a channel determined by the nonce.
    -   The Two apps, 3rd party login and my Digital ID websocket login are bound by the nonce websocket channel.

5.  **Final Token Generation and Authentication**
    -   Once the 3-way handshaking process is accomplished (includes the password verification), a JWT Token is responded to Keycloak.
    -   The JWT Token responded by MyDOW OIDC to Keycloak will consist of full name and IC Number.
    -   Once Keycloak receives the JWT Token, Keycloak will take the claims (fullname and IC Number) and incorporate the info into a newly generated JWT token to be returned to the initiator client.

6.  **Resource Access**
    -   The user accesses the application with the JWT token.
    -   The application validates the token with Keycloak.
    -   Upon successful validation, Keycloak informs the application, and the application provides access to the requested resources.

#### MyDigital ID SSO Keycloak Client

A Keycloak client is an application or service that interacts with Keycloak for authentication and authorization. In Keycloak, a "client" can be any system that integrates with Keycloak to use its identity management capabilities, such as single sign-on (SSO), user authentication, and role-based access control (RBAC).

Keycloak clients are typically web applications, mobile applications, or even backend services that use Keycloak to authenticate users and obtain access tokens, or they could be microservices that need to secure their APIs.

##### MyDigital ID SSO Keycloak Client Configuration

When configuring a Keycloak client, you usually specify the following settings:

1.  **Client ID**: A unique identifier for the client within Keycloak. This is how Keycloak knows which client is making a request.
2.  **Client Secret**: A secret key used for secure communication between the client and Keycloak (in the case of confidential clients).
3.  **Redirect URI**: The URL to which Keycloak will redirect the user after successful authentication. This is typically the URL of the application that the user is trying to access.
4.  **Protocol**: The authentication protocol used by the client. Common protocols include:
    -   **OpenID Connect** (OIDC) -- A modern protocol based on OAuth 2.0, commonly used for web and mobile applications.
    -   **OAuth 2.0** -- A framework for access delegation, widely used for authorization.
5.  **Access Type**:
    -   **Confidential**: Clients that can securely store credentials (e.g., server-side applications). These clients authenticate themselves to Keycloak using client secrets.
    -   **Public**: Clients that cannot securely store credentials (e.g., single-page applications, mobile apps).
    -   **Bearer-only**: Clients that only accept access tokens and cannot initiate authentication themselves. Common for APIs or resource servers.
6.  **Roles and Scopes**: The permissions or access levels that the client can request, often used to limit or specify access to certain resources or actions.

##### Client Flow in MyDigital ID SSO Keycloak

1.  A user accesses a client application and is redirected to Keycloak for authentication.
2.  Keycloak authenticates the user (e.g., through login credentials, social login, etc.).
3.  After successful authentication, Keycloak sends an authorization code or access token back to the client application (depending on the flow used).
4.  The client can use the token to make authorized API calls, or the token can be stored for the duration of the session.

##### Example of Client Flow in MyDigital ID SSO Keycloak Use Cases

-   **Web Application**: A client in Keycloak could represent a React or Angular app that interacts with a backend API to fetch user data after authentication.
-   **Mobile App**: A client could represent a mobile app that needs to authenticate users via Keycloak and interact with a REST API.
-   **Service-to-Service Communication**: A client could also be a backend service that needs to authenticate itself when calling other services or APIs.

In summary, a MyDigital ID SSO Keycloak client is a representation of an application or service that uses Keycloak for handling authentication and authorization, with various settings and protocols to define its interaction with Keycloak's identity management features.
